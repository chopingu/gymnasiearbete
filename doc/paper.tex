\begin{abstract}
    In late 2017 DeepMind announced a groundbreaking system in a preprint \cite{alphazero} and the results were astonishing. The system was called AlphaZero and utilized \emph{artificial neural networks} in combination with \emph{heuristic algorithms} in order to teach itself the game chess without any proprietary knowledge. After approximately 9 hours it was able to beat the strongest hand-crafted engines, such as Stockfish and it had learned centuries of human knowledge of chess. In this paper we aim to study the effectiveness of different \emph{neural networks} and \emph{heuristic algorithms} such as the one used in AlphaZero. More precisely, we intend to analyze the efficiency of those networks and algorithms in combination with varying \emph{optimizations, parameters, hyperparameters} and \emph {architectures} applied to the classic games \emph{Connect Four} and \emph{Othello}. \\[0.5in]
